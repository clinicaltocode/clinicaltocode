## The 3 AM Reality Check

It's 3 AM in the ICU. I have six critical patients, and I need to document a code blue, administer medications for four patients, and respond to three bed alarms. Your EHR just crashed. Again.

This isn't a rare occurrence—it's Tuesday.

## The Disconnect Between Design and Reality

After 20 years as an ICU nurse and now as a clinical informaticist, I've witnessed the massive gap between how IT teams think nursing works and how it actually works. Let me paint you the real picture.

### The Medication Administration Myth

**What IT Thinks Happens:**
1. Nurse receives order
2. Nurse gets medication
3. Nurse scans patient
4. Nurse scans medication
5. Nurse documents
6. Complete!

**What Actually Happens:**
1. Order arrives (if I'm lucky enough to see the notification)
2. Check patient status—are they even stable enough?
3. Review allergies (because the EHR missed one)
4. Calculate dosage (the EHR suggestion is wrong 30% of the time)
5. Find working scanner (third attempt)
6. Scanner battery dies
7. Type in medication manually
8. Document in three different places because of "compliance"
9. Get interrupted four times
10. Start over because session timed out

## What Nurses Actually Need

### 1. Mobile-First Design
We're not sitting at desks. We're moving constantly. Your beautiful desktop interface is useless when I'm responding to a code.

### 2. Offline Functionality
When the network goes down (not if, when), I still need to save lives. Give us offline mode with smart sync.

### 3. Voice Documentation
My hands are literally inside a patient. Voice commands aren't luxury—they're necessity.

## The Path Forward

Here's my proposal for IT leaders ready to build EHRs that actually work:

1. **Shadow a nurse for a full 12-hour shift** (night shift, preferably)
2. **Count the clicks** required for basic tasks
3. **Time the workflows** during actual emergencies
4. **Listen to the cursing**—that's where your UX fails

## Making the Change

I'm not anti-technology. I'm pro-technology-that-works. The best EHR implementation I've seen? The one where three nurses sat in every design meeting.

Your clinical staff aren't resistant to change. We're resistant to changes that make our jobs harder and patient care worse.

## Call to Action

IT leaders: Your next EHR committee needs at least 40% clinical staff. Not administrators who haven't touched a patient in years—actual, working, bedside staff.

Because at 3 AM, when someone's life hangs in the balance, your EHR better work exactly how a nurse needs it to work.
